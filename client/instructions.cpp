@main Set-up instructions

The following instructions are for creating this react + pyhton website from scratch, so you can recreate the project actually

npm install -g create-react-app (install npm)

create-react-app acb (our react app is called acb)

cd acb (change directory to acb )

npm start (I think you should have npm installed to be able to run this command)

Delete the src/App.css, src/App.test.js, src/logo.svg, and src/setupTests.js (we don't really need them)

Update the src/App.js file to remove the references to the deleted files, then import React from 'react' then
just pass a h1 in the div with "Hello world"

***/

/*** Step 2
****************************************************************************************
Set up od the Home Screen

Create a different file called homepage.js, then import it in the app.js, and pass your defined import in the div
